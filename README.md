# anki-cards-ai-generator
Flash cards and spaced repetition can be combined into powerful and effective tool for many areas of studying, from languages to university subjects.
The creation of these cards is an interesting, but sometimes time-consuming process.
There are many automations (e.g. [AnkiBrain](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/1915225457)) that can create the anki cards from prompts using ChatGPT.
However, these tools do not allow prompt customization or image creation.

## Purpose
Automate the creation of the Anki cards for learning words or phrases in different languages. 
This tool is a card generator, [Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net/) can be used for learning process.

Workflow:
1. Create list of words or phrases with some context
2. Start the generation
3. Enjoy the new Anki deck with generated text, image, audio and dictionary link in your Anki app

### Supported Languages
- English (with [Cambridge Dictionary](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/))
- German (with [DWDS](https://www.dwds.de/))

### Language Levels
You can choose a CERF language level for card generation: A1, A2, B1, B2, C1, C2.

Note, that not all words can be explained at the beginner levels. 

### Synchronization
Cards are imported into local Anki client, and pictures are copied to the Anki media folder (e.g. to 'C:\\Users\\User\\AppData\\Roaming\\Anki2\\User 1\\collection.media').  

Afterwards, Anki can be synchronized with AnkiWeb, and the deck can be used from other devices. Versions for different devices can downloaded [here](https://apps.ankiweb.net/#windows). 

The synchronization is very straightforward, and is described [here](https://docs.ankiweb.net/syncing.html).

## Prerequisites
1. This is an application that automates Anki cards creation process using the ChatGPT, DALLE and TTS models. Your [OpenAI API](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys) key is required. You can set environment variable OPENAI_API_KEY or use --openai_api_key option.
2. [Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net/) must be installed.
3. Add-on [AnkiConnect](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/2055492159) is used for the import of the cards. It must be installed. AnkiConnect website contains short installation guide.
4. Anki is running.
5. Tool is compatible with python 3.10+

## Usage
Syntax:  
```bash
read-generate-import.py input_file processing_directory \
          [-h] \
          [--openai_api_key OPENAI_API_KEY] \
          [--deck_name DECK_NAME] \
          [--anki_media_directory_path ANKI_MEDIA_DIRECTORY_PATH] \
          [--language {english,german}] \
          [--level {A1,A2,B1,B2,C1,C2}] 
```

input_file processing_directory and processing directory can be relative or absolute paths.

### Default settings
```bash
python -m generator.read-generate-import ./demo/input_words.csv ./processing
```
Defaults are:
- Language is English
- Level is C1
- OpenAI API key is and expected to be set in environment variable OPENAI_API_KEY
- Deck name is autogenerated, containing current date
- Default Anki media directory path for Windows, Linux and MacOS

### Custom settings
```bash
python -m generator.read-generate-import ./demo/input_words.csv ./processing  \
          --language="german" \
          --level="B2" \
          --openai_api_key="YOUR_KEY" \
          --deck_name="my_amazing_deck" \
          --anki_media_directory_path="custom_path/Anki2/User/collection.media"
```
### Input
CSV with semicolon as separator (you can use commas in sentences and context), or an Excel file.
Header "word;context" is expected.
Example:
```csv
word;context
tax fraud;
purchasing power parity;economy
affect;
consciousness;the state of human being
free will;
```

### Output
Card materials are created in the specified directory. 
Tool creates for each word:
- json with card text, paths and links
- png with generated image  
- mp3 with generated audio
- dictionary link (if the link was found)

After generation, these files are used for card creation. 
Generated cards are imported into Anki deck automatically.

An example input file, generated elements and card screenhots can be found in [Demo](demo).

## OpenAI API
Text: [gpt-4o](https://platform.openai.com/docs/models/gpt-4o)  
Image: [dall-e-3](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/images/usage), 3 RPM, 200 RPD - main throughput limitation  
Audio: [tts-1-hd](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/text-to-speech)  

### Cost
Billing: https://platform.openai.com/settings/organization/billing/overview

DALLE-3 call is the most expensive step, 0.04$ per image. This is expensive compared with free images, but:
- Sometimes it is really difficult to find an image that describes some abstract content.
- These images boost (at least mine) learning process a lot
- Cards are much better than DALLE-2 cards in this use case

Text generation is much cheaper, less than 0.01$ per card. Total cost of a card is <= 0.05$ pro card.

## FAQ
Q: Audio file plays when I'm opening the card, I don't like it!  
A: By default, Anki automatically plays audio on the front and back of cards. You can choose ["Don't play audio automatically"](https://docs.ankiweb.net/deck-options.html) in deck options. In this case Anki will not play audio until you click the replay audio button.  

Q: I don't like the generated cards!  
A: At first, try to regenerate the card, maybe provide more context. If the tool creates something totally wrong - please create an issue on GitHub. You can also adjust the prompts at your own discretion.  

Q: Will this tool correct my typos?  
A: No, Garbage In - Garbage Out. If ChatGPT understands your input, the tool will create a contextually correct card that may include your typo on the back of the card. You can fix it manually in the anki app or regenerate the card.  

Q: Card text is too complicated, I don't know these words or constructions!  
A: You can set the language complexity with --level option.  

Q: I like the tool, but I would like to use it with another language...  
A: For this purpose, it is required to:  
1. Check whether the language is supported by ChatGPT.  
2. Translate prompts for text generation, and adjust them. Probably we will require help of person with a good language level. 
3. Good dictionary, to place a link in cards (dictionary can be ignored).  
4. Create an issue with this information, or create a fork.

anki_prompt_preamble = """I want you to act like a professional Anki card maker, able to create Anki cards from the text I provide.

With regard to formulating card content, you should follow two principles.
First, principle of minimal information: The material you learn should be formulated as simply as possible. Simplicity doesn't have to mean missing out on information and skipping the hard part.
Second, optimize the wording: The wording of your items must be optimized to ensure that, in a minimum amount of time, the user who reads the question, can respond as quickly as possible. This will reduce error rates, increase specificity, reduce response time, and help your concentration.

You can not use the word from input in the output. It should be masked with underscores.

Create Anki cards based on the text above as follows:

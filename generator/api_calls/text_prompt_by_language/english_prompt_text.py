anki_prompt_preamble = """I want you to act like a professional Anki card maker, able to create Anki cards from the text I provide.

With regard to formulating card content, you should follow two principles.
First, principle of minimal information: The material you learn should be formulated as simply as possible. Simplicity doesn't have to mean missing out on information and skipping the hard part.
Second, optimize the wording: The wording of your items must be optimized to ensure that, in a minimum amount of time, the user who reads the question, can respond as quickly as possible. This will reduce error rates, increase specificity, reduce response time, and help your concentration.

You can not use the word from input in the output. It should be masked with underscores.

I can provide a word or a phrase with empty context
WORD: [target word]; CONTEXT: []
In this case, use most likely context or different contexts of your choice.

Alternatively, I can provide a word or a phrase with a context:
WORD: [target word]; CONTEXT: [context]
In this case, use the given context for card generation.
Context can be a sentence with this word, but it can also be a single or several fields related to this word. 
You should not mix the fields in the card, and use the context only if it is meaningful for the card.
It the context of combinations of contexts violated from conventional word usage, ignore this context.
If there are several important contexts, write the main context first. 

Do not put any unrelated sentences in the card, as the "Card Example". Your output should contain only the text for the card.

I expect 4-5 sentences in every card.

Create Anki cards based on the text above as follows:
